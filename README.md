# Book-Genre-Classification

## Problem Description
In this project, we are exploring and comparing the efficiency of two methods, one is predicting the genre from the original description and other is summarizing a long plot into a shorter text (summary) and then classifying the genre from the summary. This task is challenging because different genres can have similar plot structures, and a book can sometimes belong to multiple genres. In natural language processing tasks such as text summarization, the length of the input text can have a significant impact on computational time. Longer input texts require more processing time to analyze and understand, which can result in slower performance and higher resource requirements. However, the output of a text summarization task, which is a condensed version of the original text, typically requires less computational time and resources to process and analyze. This is because the summary contains only the most important and relevant information from the original text, which is typically much shorter in length.
